What is the difference between var and let?

You can redeclare var but you cannot redeclare let. If I write var one = 1, then var one = 2 it will work. let would not.


What is the difference between var and const?

Again you can reassign/redeclare with var but const is a constant. Once it is declared, it cannot be reassigned OR redeclared.


What is the difference between let and const?

You can reassign with let, but you can not redeclare or reassign using const.

What is hoisting?

JS compiler lifts or "hoists" to the tope of what they're declared in.
